# WebMSNP
WebMSNP is a lightweight web-based client for the MSNP instant messaging protocol!

This repository contains the Rust-based source code for the server.

## Servers
As of right now, there is **1** website hosting this server:
- https://webmsnp.kooper.online (not 24/7, expect downtimes to be sudden and prolonged)

Even so, it is highly recommended to host WebMSNP yourself!

## Compatibility
This client is not just designed for mobile devices in mind, but specifically (at least) the WebKit version provided in iOS 6.

Any browser from then on should run WebMSNP fine.[^1]

## Features (besides core functionality)
- Specify your own MSNP11-compatible server on login
- Send and receive nudges
- Make additions to your contact list
- View contact's status (online, offline, away, etc.) and change your own
- View contact's personal message
- Change your own personal message

## Todo (in descending order of priority
- [ ] Replace web app icon with something original (https://github.com/dskooper/webmsnp/issues/1)
- [ ] See your username and personal message
- [ ] Change your username and personal message
- [ ] Allow users to *remove* contacts
- [ ] View profile pictures
- [ ] Dark mode?

### List of "wontfix" features
- Winks:
  - Requires Adobe Flash which was never available on iOS[^2] and dropped from Android after Ice Cream Sandwich. <br>
- File transfers:
  - Personally out of scope, WebMSNP is not supposed to be a feature-complete client (and also idk how to implement). <br>
    If you want to transfer files use something like [Litterbox](https://litterbox.catbox.moe)
- Voice/video calling:
  - Very out of scope considering it probably wouldn't work on mobile devices (assuming I knew how to implement that in the first place)
- MSN emoticons:
  - This would likely get me in legal trouble with Microsoft. All mobile devices basically come with emoji pickers anyway so just use those
- Custom emoticons:
  - Not implemented by the MSNP11 SDK yet, either way MSN emoticons won't be added so why this?

## Building
### Prerequisites
- The Rust programming language, downloadable from [here](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/).
  - By association, any operating system that is still supported by Rust.

Once installed, you can do the following:
- Linux:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/dskooper/webmsnp
  cd webmsnp
  ./build-release.sh
  ```
- Windows:
  1. Download the entire repository by clicking on [this link](https://github.com/dskooper/webmsnp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
  2. Extract the repository into a folder and enter it.
  3. Right click on `build-release.ps1` and press on "Run with PowerShell`

If successful, there should now be a `build-rel` folder containing an executable.

## Usage
Once compiled, you can launch the server executable to immediately start hosting on 0.0.0.0 port 27677[^3]. <br>
